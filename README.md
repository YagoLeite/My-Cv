# Online version of my resume

Everybody needs a good resume to get your dream job. If you are a web developer, you have to build it online. That is exactly what I did.


To do it, I used only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The resume has links to my social media and to my main projects.

One of the challenges I've faced was to make it responsible. But, who hasn't faced it?
